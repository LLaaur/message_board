Simple message board app built using HTML, CSS, JS and Node.js and Express.js!

Things I've learned:

I. What node and express are and why they are helpful for the server-side of a web app.

II. How to use express to generate a basic skeleton website.

III. How create and acces routes with Express.js

IV. What a templating language is and how to use it. (used pug and jade for this project)

V. A more in-depth look and practice with network request and status codes.

VI. How to deploy an app using Railway.app
